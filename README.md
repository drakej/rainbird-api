# rainbird-api
This is a restful API written in golang that talks to both the rainbird.com phone-api as well as the local API provided on the RainBird controller itself. It does this by utilizing jsonrpc 2.0 calls to match what the phone applications utilize. 

*This project has no affiliation with RainBird and is purely a reverse engineered effort. As a result it may break at any time as RainBird could potentially update their firmware and cloud based API to no longer work with this software.*

*You use this software at your own risk*
